```
HotlistAI Labs builds AI-powered systems that run businesses on autopilot.

We create orchestrated multi-agent tools that handle strategy, product, growth, and operations—so founders and teams can focus on what actually matters.

Our approach is different: we don't build tools so users can learn systems. We build tools that learn them.

THE LAB
Everything starts in the Lab. We incubate ideas, stress-test them with real users, and graduate the best into standalone products. Not everything ships—but what does is battle-tested and built to last.

THE HOTLIST STANDARD
Every product that leaves our Lab meets the Hotlist Standard:
• Human-first — Technology serves people, not the reverse
• Agent-powered — Multi-agent orchestration under the hood
• Conversational — No learning curve, just talk
• Modular — Swap, upgrade, expand without friction
• Minimal — Clean interface, deep capability

OUR PRODUCTS
We're building AI boardrooms for real estate, intelligent coding environments, and video generation tools—all powered by orchestrated agents working together.

DESIGN PHILOSOPHY
Black and white. Sharp lines. No distractions. We build tools for people who value clarity, leverage, and power—without noise.

Founded by Johnny Apple.

## 04 — LinkedIn Personal (Johnny Apple)

### Setup Information

**Headline (220 characters):**

```
Founder @ HotlistAI Labs | Building AI systems that run businesses on autopilot | Real estate meets AI
```

**About:**

```
I build AI systems that run businesses on autopilot.

I'm the founder of HotlistAI Labs, where we create orchestrated multi-agent tools that handle strategy, product, growth, and operations—so founders and teams can focus on what actually matters.

My background is in real estate, which taught me one thing: most businesses are bottlenecked by repetitive, high-stakes work that humans shouldn't have to do manually.

So I started building tools that fix that.

Our products:
→ Estate Mogul — AI boardroom for real estate professionals
→ Orchid — Intelligent coding environment for builders
→ Hotlist Agent — Direct-to-agent video generation

Everything we build follows the Hotlist Standard: human-first, agent-powered, conversational, modular, and minimal.

I write about AI, building in public, and what's actually working at hotlistai.substack.com.

Let's connect if you're building in the AI space or want to explore what multi-agent systems could do for your business.
